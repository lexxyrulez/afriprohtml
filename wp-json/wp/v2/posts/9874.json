With the knowledge that cyber attacks cost the British industry approximately \u00a334 billion a year, it\u2019s of no real surprise that the percentage is so high.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all this evidence of the regularity of cyber attacks and the extortionate amounts of money they cause businesses to lose, Cyber Security must be a top priority for senior management, right? Not exactly. Whilst two-thirds of businesses surveyed have some form of Cyber Security budget, for many Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), it\u2019s not enough. So how do you answer your company\u2019s board\u2019s arguments against further Cyber Security investment and convince them of its importance?<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>\u2018Cyber security isn\u2019t relevant to our company\u2019<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a common argument, particularly in SMEs. For businesses who still conduct a substantial proportion of their work offline, it\u2019s difficult to understand why Cyber Security is so important. Yet any company that processes data online \u2013 whether that\u2019s employee or customer data \u2013 needs to invest in Cyber Security in some form, particularly with the<\/span><a href=\"\/2017\/05\/08\/preparing-gdpr-5-things-business-needs-know\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GDPR\u2019s incoming enforcement<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your board may not think the customer data your company processes is of any value, but under new GDPR rules, anything that can identify an individual will be considered personal data \u2013 including name, location, and even IP address and cookies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Convince your board against this argument with reference to two of its biggest fears \u2013 financial woes and loss of reputation. Explain the fines the company could face if they are found not to have adequate protection against data breaches, alongside the loss of loyal customers and public reputation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>\u2018We can\u2019t afford to employ a Cyber Security expert\u2019<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your board won\u2019t just be considering the costs involved in the purchase of Cyber Security systems, but the costs of employing or training someone to implement them. This is a difficult argument to counter \u2013 you simply can\u2019t get around the fact that money will need to be spent. One option to consider is outsourcing all your Cyber Security needs. Not only will the company save on employment costs, it shifts the bulk of the responsibility from team members who may not see Cyber Security as \u2018their job\u2019 to a trusted expert team, giving your board peace of mind that everything is in hand.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>\u2018I didn\u2019t realise we were at risk\u2019<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/609186\/Cyber_Security_Breaches_Survey_2017_main_report_PUBLIC.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over a fifth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of organisations\u2019 senior managers are never given an update on Cyber Security issues, hence they don\u2019t realise the scale and significance. By simply implementing a reporting system to the board, which details possible threats and solutions, you can rapidly increase your chances of securing further investment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>\u2018I\u2019d rather take the risk and spend the money if there is an incident\u2019<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is one of the most frustrating things the company\u2019s Cyber Security champion can hear. Many businesses think security breaches will never happen to them so why should they invest? And even if it does happen, surely it\u2019ll cost less to deal with a one-off incident than to invest in Cyber Security systems and staff? If your board present this argument, simply explain the amount of money the company could lose if a security breach caused company emails or file drives to stop working, causing an almost total loss of productivity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This would not only impact on revenue, but on customer reputation. Imagine telling your customers you can\u2019t deal with their enquiry for a week because you can\u2019t access your emails? If possible, back up your argument with the projected losses if this were to happen, and compare them to the costs of investing more in cyber security investment. It\u2019ll soon become apparent which is the better option!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Still need a hand convincing your board to invest in cyber security?<a href=\"http:\/\/falanx.com\/contact\/\"> Get
