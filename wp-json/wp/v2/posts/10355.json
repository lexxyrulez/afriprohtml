These tests reveal if your systems or applications will withstand hostile attacks and whether discovered vulnerabilities can lead to further intrusion and exploitation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Why should you pen test?<\/h3>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-10337 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/falanxcyber.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Magnifier.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"72\" height=\"61\" \/>Uncover Critical Vulnerabilities in Your Organisation<br \/>\n<\/strong>To help you understand to what extent your organisation\u2019s vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited by hackers. Each penetration test reveals how your systems are vulnerable to potential cyber-attacks and provides recommendations on how to strengthen your cyber security posture.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, once vulnerabilities are found, rather than merely reporting the vulnerability, penetration testers use their skills to exploit these vulnerabilities, thereby proving real-world attack vectors against your organisation\u2019s IT assets, data, and staff.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-10209 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/falanxcyber.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Reporting-icon-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"72\" height=\"54\" \/>Enable You to Prioritise and Address Risks<br \/>\n<\/strong>At Falanx Cyber, every penetration test that we conduct will conclude with a detailed report of your organisation\u2019s exploitable vulnerabilities, complete with actionable recommendations as to remediate against these vulnerabilities.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-10339 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/falanxcyber.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Shield.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"63\" height=\"84\" \/>Assisting You in Meeting Industry and Regulatory Compliance<br \/>\n<\/strong>Should your organisation need to comply with certain industry standards and regulations including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), ISO 27001, NIST, FISMA, HIPAA, or Sarbanes-Oxley, regularly conducted penetration testing will contribute towards achieving compliance. By implementing regular penetration tests of your organisation\u2019s environment, you will be demonstrating information security due-diligence; such due-diligence can negate significant fines resulting from non-compliance.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-10335 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/falanxcyber.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Info.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"60\" height=\"52\" \/>Informing Senior Management About Levels of Risk<br \/>\n<\/strong>Today\u2019s senior management now like to have an understanding as to how able their organisation is at withstanding cyber-attacks. Therefore, our reports come complete with an easily understood Executive Summary. This provides valuable insights into your organisation\u2019s levels of risk and exposure in non-technical terms.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>When Should You Penetration Test?<\/h3>\n<p>Penetration testing should be undertaken after deployment of new infrastructure and applications as well as post-major changes to infrastructure and applications (e.g. patches and upgrades to software, changes to firewall rules, and updating of firmware). Pen tests generally should be performed right before a system is put into production and once it is no longer in a state of constant change. If a pen test is undertaken too early, your systems or networks can still have changes constantly occurring and as a result, possible security holes might be overlooked.<\/p>\n<p>As an organisation, pushing new services live without having conducted the proper security assessments can leave yourself open to unnecessary risk and a potential infiltrated attack. This risk needs to be evaluated and put in perspective when instigating a new system.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>How Often Should You Penetration Test?<\/h3>\n<p>Whilst the frequency of testing will be influenced by the criticality of the target, we recommend testing should be at least annually, with monthly vulnerability scanning for Internet facing infrastructure and apps. Certain compliance standards (e.g. the PCI DSS) have recommended intervals for various scan types.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding your company\u2019s line of business is absolutely crucial to successful security testing. With new software and changes being made on a continual basis, systems will need to be retested and tested regularly.<\/p>\n<p><em>By<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Alec Auer &#8211; <\/em><em>Senior Penetration Tester<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>READ NEXT: Case study &#8211; facilitating compliance and winning new customers with penetration testing and ISO 27001 gap analysis<\/h4>\n<p><a class=\"button\" href=\"\/2020\/04\/30\/hooyu\/\">READ CASE STUDY<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>About Falanx Cyber<br \/>\n<\/strong>Falanx Cyber puts enterprise-class cyber security services within reach of every organisation.
