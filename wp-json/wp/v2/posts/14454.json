Andrew you&#8217;ve got more in this?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Wood [AW]: Yes, Russia says it doesn&#8217;t do such things. It says America does but America is still asking businesses to consider the risks.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Let\u2019s talk now to Rob Shapland at the cyber security consultancy Falanx Cyber. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>A good morning to you Rob, the European Commission is proposing new regulations to monitor cyber security. Sounds like that&#8217;s coming rather late &#8211; now that there&#8217;s a war going on in Ukraine. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Rob Shapland [RS]: Morning Andrew, yeah it is rather late. I mean this is stuff we should have been doing a long time ago. We&#8217;ve known for a while that a lot of our businesses are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks and if Russia does expand beyond Ukraine in what is targeting then along these businesses could be very vulnerable so it&#8217;s right time to put these regulations in now, but it would be better to put them in earlier definitely. \u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>AW: So what kind of attacks can businesses expect at the moment? How might say a Russian attack be different to just an ordinary hacker who wants to mess around? Or just cause mischief?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>RS: Well it seems to be a bit more capable. So there&#8217;s two main types of attack that they will see. So first ones called denial of service which is kind of when you\u2019d send a massive amount of data a website or company and knock them offline for a period in time. But it&#8217;s a bit like shining a torch in someone&#8217;s eyes &#8211; you know any last for a few seconds, remove it away and it goes away. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The more damaging ones are ransomware wiper attacks where Russian entities will attempt to infiltrate a network. They&#8217;ll then take all the data and either encrypt or just destroy it. Essentially crippled the company so any company that&#8217;s not got their cyber security defences in place could potentially be the target of this and it could have a massive effect on their ability to operate as a business. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>AW: If you were in the Russian military what would you be targeting in business in the West? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>RS: Well, I would be going for critical national infrastructure; water, power, etcetera. That is very well defended but also looking to disrupt the financial system as a way of getting back at the sanctions. They can\u2019t attack us directly without escalating the war but they can do cyberattacks without doing that so I would go for financial institutions try to sort of counteract those sanctions in a way<\/p>\n<p><strong>Okay Rob Shapland at the cyber security consultancy Falanx Cyber. Some useful tips. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Their business could well become collateral damage in the what&#8217;s going on well there&#8217;s the increasing dispute between the West and Russia over Ukraine. <\/strong>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column][\/vc_column][vc_column][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1648028281845{margin-top: 30px !important;padding-bottom: 30px !important;}&#8221;]Rob Shapland, Head of Innovation and Ethical Hacker, joined the&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":14456,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[6,89,121,120,123],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 -
