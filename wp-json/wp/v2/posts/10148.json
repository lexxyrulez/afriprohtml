The costs arise from the attack itself, the remediation and repairing, time taken to deal with it and reputational damage by regaining public trust.<\/li>\n<li>2% of senior decision makers who knew the sum lost that it cost the business suffered \u00a3250,000,000 worth of damage and 9% of those who knew experienced between \u00a3100,000 &#8211; \u00a3499,999 worth of damage.<\/li>\n<li>59% of those who knew how much the business had suffered financially as a result of the cyber-crime attack had between \u00a31,000 and \u00a3250,000,000 worth of damage done.<\/li>\n<li>65% of businesses experienced between \u00a3100 &#8211; \u00a399,999 worth of damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Rob Shapland, ethical hacker, Falanx Cyber said: \u201cThe findings of the survey reinforce the risk that businesses of all sizes are facing from cyber-crime, and the financial implications of not being prepared. Relatively small investments in cyber defence, such as awareness training for staff, regular penetration testing and Managed Detection and Response (MDR), can ensure not only is the business protected, but also has the ability to respond appropriately should an attack occur.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>About Falanx Cyber<\/p>\n<h6>Falanx Cyber puts enterprise-class cyber security services within reach of every organisation.
