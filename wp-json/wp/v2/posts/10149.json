They might try and influence someone within the company. The easiest way might be, for example, to bribe a cleaner to take a USB stick with them to plug into the network, logging keystrokes and now I have the passwords. I could log in as someone that works there, steal information from the network. Imagine that at a big pharmaceutical company, selling plans for drugs could potentially be worth millions.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like what you see in the moves:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cA lot of the times it\u2019s the companies employees, rather than doing as you see in the movies where you got a hacker in their basement listening to metal music and tapping away. You actually target the people that work at a company so a typical way to do it is to send them a phishing email so something like a link or attachment, you go on social media to look through their Instagram photos you find out they&#8217;ve been to a hotel recently. Then, pretend to be from the hotel and send an email saying you\u2019ve left valuables in your room click on these photos to see. Via these photographs, I now have access to their computer at work and I can do whatever I want with it. I can steal information from it, I can turn the webcam on and look at them if I really want to.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>On how trusting employees within office environments can be and being an inside man:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cPeople are very, very trusting &#8211; which is a nice thing but it often makes it very easy for me to dress up (as a security guard) and get into their building. Once I&#8217;m inside I\u2019m normally trusted, especially in a big company. If you got 1000\u2019s of people working in an office, you wear a suit and tie, you look comfortable, you go to the kitchen to make a cup of coffee you sit down in a hot-desking area -everyone just thinks you work there and it\u2019s possible to hack away from the inside.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cIt\u2019s quite rare to actually use someone on the inside to do it. It\u2019s normally done by phishing which is why most cybersecurity education is about being careful what you click on. Even if it happens, most companies have systems in place to detect these attacks before they even happen.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Watch the interview on Falanx Cyber Official YouTube <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?time_continue=34&amp;v=TqY_Snmh-p0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>About Rob Shapland, Head of Awareness, Falanx Cyber<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Rob Shapland is an ethical hacker with 12 years\u2019 experience attacking the defences of hundreds of organisations, from small businesses to major international organisations.
