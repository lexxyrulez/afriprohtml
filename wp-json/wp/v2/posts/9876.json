These things are not preventative measures \u2013 they simply minimise risk to your data once there has been an attempt to access it. There\u2019s one thing, however, that businesses can do to to pre-empt attacks and minimise the possibility of malicious interception of their systems: security awareness training.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put simply, people are often the weakest link in the cyber-security chain. Security awareness training is your business\u2019s best shot at tackling security threats at the first possible instance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are three reasons why your employees need security awareness training.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Human error accounts for two thirds of data breaches<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.computerweekly.com\/news\/450297535\/Human-error-causes-more-data-loss-than-malicious-attacks\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a report last year, 62% of incidents reported to the ICO were caused by human error<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Whether it\u2019s a mistake as simple as sending documents to the wrong email address, or an employee falling for a phishing scam, human error is the biggest threat to your business\u2019s IT systems. Security awareness training is a vital tool in informing your employees on the risks of poor cyber hygiene. Recognising phishing emails, understanding the risks \u2018bring-your-own-device\u2019 (BYOD), and knowing how to securely share and dispose of data are just a few simple key things that security awareness training can help with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It might seem that many of these points are common sense, but research shows us again and again how users aren\u2019t aware of how their poor practice \u2013 such as weak passwords \u2013 puts data at risk.<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2016\/jan\/20\/123456-worst-passwords-revealed\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In 2016, \u2018123456\u2019 and \u2018password\u2019 topped the list of the most common passwords <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for the sixth year in a row<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People won\u2019t learn unless you teach them, and seeing as phishing scams are getting smarter year-on-year, isn\u2019t it important that your employees are too?<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Your business is subject to strict regulations<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re a huge multinational company like Yahoo or a small start-up, every business has data that is valuable to hackers. This knowledge alone should be enough for businesses to invest in preventative measures, such as security awareness training, but unfortunately for many businesses it isn\u2019t. Many organisations only take cyber security seriously if they a) have the time and budget, or b) are subject to regulations that force them to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately (yes, we mean fortunately),<\/span><a href=\"\/2017\/05\/08\/preparing-gdpr-5-things-business-needs-know\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the introduction of the GDPR next year<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> affects essentially almost every business currently in operation, including yours. If you process the data of EU citizens in any way, you\u2019re subject to it \u2013 you don\u2019t necessarily have to be the data controller. And with fines of 4% of global turnover or \u20ac20 million, the cost of investing in security awareness training is pretty insignificant.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>It could be more expensive not to<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of cost, it\u2019s important to realise that security awareness training is an investment in your business. In the instance of a successful data breach, your business could lose a lot more than the time and money spent on training. Not only could your business be subject to the colossal fines, you could lose even more than just a percentage of your takings. With any security breach, there\u2019s a serious risk to a business\u2019s reputation.<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cisco.com\/c\/en\/us\/products\/security\/security-reports.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CISCO\u2019s latest annual cyber security report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that 22% of breached organizations lost customers, with a large percentage of these losing 20% of their entire customer base. Security awareness training is a simple measure that could prevent a domino effect which could have the potential to close down your organisation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Want to find out more about what Falanx Cyber Defence\u00a0can do for your business?<\/b><a href=\"\/contact\/\"> <b>Get in touch here.<\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Before you read any further, there\u2019s one essential piece of information that you must take&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":11405,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[6,82],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Do my employees need security awareness training?
