Your finance team tracks expenditure and income day to day. An audit by an external group ensures that your internal team&#8217;s processes are sufficient. Equally, you should know what the penetration testers are going to find, before they find it. Armed with a good understanding of the vulnerabilities present in your system, you can use third-party penetration tests to verify your own expectations.<\/p>\n<p>Our highly experienced penetration testers may find subtle issues which your internal processes have not picked up, but this should be the exception, not the rule. The aim should always be to use the findings of a penetration test report to improve your organisation&#8217;s internal vulnerability assessment and management processes.<\/p>\n<h3>What Will a Penetration Test Tell You?<\/h3>\n<p>Typically, our penetration tests are used to identify the level of technical risk emanating from software and hardware vulnerabilities. Exactly what techniques are used, what targets are allowed, how much knowledge of the system is given to our testers beforehand and how much knowledge of the test is given to system administrators can vary within the same test regime.<\/p>\n<p>A well-scoped penetration test can give confidence that the products and security controls tested have been configured in accordance with good practice and that there are no common or publicly known vulnerabilities in the tested components, <em>at the time of the test<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h3>What Sorts of Systems Should be Tested?<\/h3>\n<p>Penetration testing is an appropriate method for identifying the risks present on specific, operational systems consisting of products and services from multiple vendors. It could also be usefully applied to systems and applications that have been developed &#8216;in-house&#8217;.<\/p>\n<h3>Falanx \u2013 A Trusted Penetration Testing Company<\/h3>\n<p>A penetration test can only validate that your organisation&#8217;s IT systems are not vulnerable to <em>known issues<\/em> <em>on the day of the test<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for organisations to let a year or more to elapse between penetration tests. So, vulnerabilities could exist for long periods of time without you knowing about them if this is your only means of validating security.<\/p>\n<p>Third party penetration tests should be performed by qualified and experienced staff only. By their nature, penetration tests cannot be entirely procedural, an exhaustive set of test cases cannot be drawn up. Therefore, the quality of a penetration test is closely linked to the abilities of the penetration testers involved.<\/p>\n<p>The UK\u2019s NCSC recommends that HMG organisations use testers and companies which are part of the CHECK scheme. Non-governmental organisations should use teams qualified under one of these certification schemes: CREST, Tiger Scheme, Cyber Scheme.<\/p>\n<p>Falanx is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a CHECK scheme organisation;<\/li>\n<li>a CREST member company;<\/li>\n<li>and a Cyber Essentials Certifying Body.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Penetration testing is an integral part of many regulatory and legal frameworks, including PCI DSS, Cyber Essentials, GDPR and ISO 27001. Therefore, our compliance testing services are designed to deliver penetration tests that meet or exceed each of these standards.<\/p>\n<h3>Why Choose Falanx?<\/h3>\n<p><strong>We are Ethical: <\/strong>because we are in a position of trust, we don\u2019t employ ex-hackers \u2013 we thoroughly vet and constantly monitor our staff who are also bound by the codes of conduct and practice of CREST and CHECK.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We are Pragmatic: <\/strong>we make sure that what you want is what you need.
